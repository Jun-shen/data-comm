# Probabilistic basis
- _Events_ are subsets of outcomes. Event defines probability.
- 0 &le; P(A) &le; 1
- P(A+B) = P(A) + P(B) if A and B are mutually exclusive, i.e. P(AB) = 0.
- P(A+B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(AB)
- Independent events: P(AB) = P(A)P(B)
- Conditional probability: P(A|B) = \frac{P(AB)}{P(B)}
- Expected value: probability weighted average.
