# Analog Signals
- __periodic signal__: with a repeat pattern in a period
- __nonperiodic signal__: without pattern or cycle that repeats over time

## Sine Wave
![](fig/sine-wave.png)

- peak amplitude (Volt) 
    - highest energy intensity
- period (Time, second) 
    - how many seconds of a signal needs to complete 1 cycle
- frequency (frequence, Hz)
    - the number of periods in 1 second
    - f=1/T, T=1/f
- phase (degree)
    - the position of the waveform relative to time 0
- wavelength (speed*period = speed/frequency)
    - &lambda;=c/f

## Time and Frequency Domain
![](fig/time-freq-domain.png)

__A complete sine wave in the time domain can be represented by one sigle spike in the frequency domain.__

### Time domain 
- the sine wave that defined by its amplitude, frequency and phase.
- shows the changes in signal amplitude with respect to time
- phase is not explicitly shown on a time-domain plot

### Frequency domain
- show the relationship between amplitude and frequency
- only concerned with the peak value and the frequency
- not show the amplitude changes during a period

## Composite Signals
![](fig/composite-signal.png)

__A composite signal is a combination of simple sine waves with different frequencies, amplitudes and phases.__
- __Periodic__ composite signal can be decomposed into a series of simple sine waves with discrete frequencies that have integer values.
- __Nonperiodic__ composite signal can be decomposed into a combination of an infinite number of simple sine waves with continuous frequencies that have real values.

## Bandwidth

__The bandwidth of a__ ___composite signal___ __is the difference between the highest and the lowest frequencies contained in that signal.__
