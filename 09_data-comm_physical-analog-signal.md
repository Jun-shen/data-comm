# Periodic Analog Signals

## Sine Wave
![](fig/sine-wave.png)

- peak amplitude (Volt) 
    - highest energy intensity
- period (Time, second) 
    - how many seconds of a signal needs to complete 1 cycle
- frequency (frequence, Hz)
    - the number of periods in 1 second
    - f=1/T, T=1/f
- phase (degree)
    - the position of the waveform relative to time 0
- wavelength (speed*period = speed/frequency)
    - &lambda;=c/f

## Time and Frequency Domain
![](fig/time-freq-domain.png)

__A complete sine wave in the time domain can be represented by one sigle spike in the frequency domain.__

### Time domain 
- the sine wave that defined by its amplitude, frequency and phase.
- shows the changes in signal amplitude with respect to time
- phase is not explicitly shown on a time-domain plot

### Frequency-domain
- show the relationship between amplitude and frequency
- only concerned with the peak value and the frequency
- not show the amplitude changes during a period
