# Fundamential Challenges

## Reliablility
Problem: noise & interference

Cause: bit error &rarr; packet loss &rarr; link failure

Solution: redundancy

Tradeoff: speed (latenct) and efficiency

## Sharing
Problem: point-to-point communication for all are expensive

Solution: shared media
- modulation & demodulation
- frequency sharing
- time sharing
- medium access contorl (MAC) protocol

## Scalability
Problem: multi-hop networks

Solution: routing (switch) technology
