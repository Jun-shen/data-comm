# Channel Capacity

## Data Rate Limits
The maximum data rate limit over a medium is decided by followinf factors:
- Bandwidth of channel
- Signal levels
- Channel quality (level of noise)

## Shannon Capacity (Noisy Channel)
__C = BW * log<sub>2</sub>(1+S/N)__

where:
- C: Channel capacity (bits per second)
- BW: Bandwidth of channel
- S/N: signal to noise ratio
