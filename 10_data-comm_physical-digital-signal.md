# Digital Signal
![](fig/digital-signal.png)
- most digital signals are ___nonperiodic___, so __periodic__ and __frequency__ are not appropriate characteristics.
- __Bit rate__ is the number of bits in 1 second (bps).
- __Bit length__ is the distance one bit occupies on the transmission medium. (The concept of __wavelength__ in analog signals)

## Time and Frequency Domain of Periodic and Nonperiodic Digital Signals

- A digital signal is a composite analog signal with an infinite bandwidth.
