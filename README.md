Data Communications and Networking is arm to introduce the principle of data communications, information transportations and computer network architectures. This course is the foundation about how to build computer network and design communication system.

Data forms:
- _Source_: the information (messages) wish to transmit.
- _Packets_: break the message for transmission over network.
- _Bits_: 0/1, On/Off.
- _Signals_: analog waves snet over physical communication links.

Communication Networks:

Fundamental challenges:
- _Reliablity_
- _Sharing_
- Scalability_
