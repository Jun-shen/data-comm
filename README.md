Data Communications and Networking is arm to introduce the principle of data communications, information transportations and computer network architectures. This course is the foundation about how to build computer network and design communication system.

Data forms:
- _Source_

    the information (messages) wish to transmit.

    How to present information: encode, compress and decode?
    
- _Packets_ 

    break the message for transmission over network.

    How networking?
    
- _Bits_

    0/1, On/Off.

    What coding technique for?
    
- _Signals_

    analog waves snet over physical communication links.

    How to modulate and demodulate for signals?

Communication Networks:
- point-to-point
- shared media
- multi-hop networks

Fundamental challenges:
- _Reliablity_
- _Sharing_
- _Scalability_
